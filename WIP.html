        "Diagnostic Features": "Alcohol use disorder is defined by a cluster of behavioral and physical symptoms, such as withdrawal, tolerance, and craving.  Alcohol withdrawal is characterized by symptoms that develop approximately 4-12 hours after reducing heavy, prolonged intake.  To avoid withdrawal, individuals may continue drinking despite adverse consequences.  Intense craving for alcohol can make it difficult to think of anything else.  The disorder can lead to neglect of major responsibilities at school, work, or home ; use in hazardous situations ; and continued use despite knowing it causes physical or psychological problems. ",
        "Associated Features": "This disorder is often associated with problems related to other substances like cannabis, cocaine, heroin, and sedatives.  Symptoms of conduct problems, depression, anxiety, and insomnia frequently accompany heavy drinking and sometimes precede it.  Repeated high-dose intake can affect nearly every organ system, especially the gastrointestinal tract, cardiovascular system, and central and peripheral nervous systems.  Specific health issues include gastritis, ulcers, liver cirrhosis, pancreatitis, increased cancer rates, hypertension, and cardiomyopathy.  Neurological effects can include cognitive deficits, severe memory impairment (Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome), and degenerative changes.  The disorder is also a significant contributor to suicide risk. ",
        "Windrawal Symptoms": "Two (or more) of the following, developing within several hours to a few days after the last drink:\nAutonomic hyperactivity (e.g., sweating, HR > 100 bpm)\nIncreased hand tremor\nInsomnia\nNausea or vomiting\nTransient visual, tactile, or auditory hallucinations or illusions\nPsychomotor agitation\nAnxiety\nGeneralized tonic-clonic seizures",
        "Prevalence": "In the United States, the lifetime prevalence of DSM-5 alcohol use disorder among adults is 29.1% (8.6% mild, 6.6% moderate, 13.9% severe).  Australian lifetime prevalence is 31.0%.  U.S. rates are higher in men (36.0%) than women (22.7%).  For DSM-IV criteria, the 12-month prevalence was 4.6% for ages 12-17, 16.2% for ages 18-29, and 1.5% for those 65 and older.  Rates vary by ethnoracial group, with Native Americans having high rates and Asian Americans having lower rates. ",
        "Development and Course": "The first episode of alcohol intoxication is likely to occur during the mid-teens.  Alcohol use disorder typically has an onset in the late teens or early to mid-20s.  The majority of individuals who develop the disorder do so by their late 30s.  The course is variable, characterized by periods of remission and relapse.  A decision to stop drinking is often followed by abstinence, but a return to drinking is highly likely to escalate.  Late-onset of the disorder (after age 40) occurs in about 10% of cases.  Older adults are more susceptible to the effects of alcohol due to age-related physical changes. ",
        "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "Environmental risk factors include poverty, discrimination, unemployment, cultural attitudes, alcohol availability, and stress levels.  Heavier peer substance use and certain coping styles also contribute.  Genetic influences account for 40%-60% of the risk variance, with a 3-4 times higher rate in close relatives.  A low level of response to alcohol is a specific risk factor, while an acute skin flush reaction (more common in persons of Asian descent) is associated with low risk.  High levels of impulsivity are associated with an earlier onset and more severe course. ",
        "Culture-Related Issues": "Alcohol is the most frequently used intoxicating substance in most cultures, contributing to 2.8 million deaths globally in 2016.  Prevalence is highest in the European and American regions.  For immigrants to the U.S., greater acculturation is linked to a higher prevalence of the disorder.  Genetic variations in alcohol-metabolizing enzymes, common in individuals of Asian descent, can be protective against the disorder but may be modulated by sociocultural factors.  The diagnostic criteria perform equally well across most U.S. race/ethnicity groups. ",
        "Sex- and Gender-Related Issues": "Men have higher rates of drinking and the disorder than women, but the gender gap is narrowing.  Females typically develop higher blood alcohol levels per drink and may be more vulnerable to some physical consequences like liver disease.  Environmental risk factors may differ by sex.  Drinking during pregnancy may be a sign of the disorder. ",
        "Diagnostic Markers": "Blood alcohol concentration can confirm recent use and indicate tolerance if an individual shows little intoxication at high levels (e.g., >150 mg/dL).  Elevated gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) and carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (CDT) are sensitive lab indicators of heavy drinking and can be used to monitor abstinence.  An elevated mean corpuscular volume (MCV) can also indicate heavy drinking.  Other nonspecific markers include elevated triglycerides and uric acid.  Physical signs can include dyspepsia, hepatomegaly, tremor, unsteady gait, and insomnia. ",
        "Association with Suicidal Thoughts or Behavior": "Acute and chronic heavy alcohol use are associated with suicide.  A meta-analysis found that acute alcohol use was associated with a nearly sevenfold increase in risk of a suicide attempt, with heavier use conferring greater risk.  Co-use with sedatives further increases this risk.  Alcohol use is also associated with a higher likelihood of using firearms in a suicide. ",
        "Functional Consequences of Alcohol Use Disorder": "The disorder impairs functioning in areas such as driving, school, work, relationships, and health.  It contributes to work absenteeism, accidents, and low productivity.  The disorder is associated with a significant increase in the risk of accidents, violence, and suicide, accounting for up to 55% of fatal driving events and being linked to criminal acts like homicide.

The symptoms cannot be due to another medical condition or mental disorder.  Incoordination can impair driving and cause accidents.  Alcohol use can be confirmed by smell, self-report, or toxicology analyses. ",
        "Associated Features": "Intoxication symptoms are often more intense when blood alcohol levels are rising.  Early in a session, stimulating effects like talkativeness may occur, while later, depressant and cognitive impairment effects emerge as levels fall.  Amnesia for events during intoxication ('blackouts') can happen at high blood alcohol levels.  At very high blood alcohol levels (>300-400 mg/dL), intoxication can be fatal in nontolerant individuals.  Intoxication is a major contributor to interpersonal violence and suicidal behavior. ",
        "Prevalence": "A large majority of alcohol consumers have likely been intoxicated at some point.  In 2018, 17.5% of U.S. 12th graders reported being drunk in the prior 30 days.  The 12-month prevalence of high-risk drinking varies by ethnoracial group, from 7.2% for Asians and Pacific Islanders to 17.4% for Native Americans. ",
        "Development and Course": "Intoxication is an episode lasting several hours.  The average age of first intoxication in the U.S. is about 15, with prevalence peaking between 18-25 years.  Earlier onset of regular intoxication predicts a greater likelihood of developing alcohol use disorder. ",
        "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "Personality traits like sensation-seeking and impulsivity increase risk.  Environmental factors include having heavy-drinking peers and using alcohol to cope with stress. ",
        "Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues": "Cultural acceptance of drunkenness varies, with some college groups encouraging it and some religious groups discouraging it. ",
        "Sex- and Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues": "Historically, intoxication was more tolerated in men, but this gender gap may be narrowing.  Women are generally less tolerant of the same amount of alcohol than men. ",
        "Diagnostic Markers": "Intoxication is usually established by behavior and smelling alcohol on the breath.  Blood or breath alcohol levels can confirm use. ",
        "Association with Suicidal Thoughts or Behavior": "Acute alcohol use independently increases the risk of suicide attempt, with each drink raising the risk by 30%. ",
        "Functional Consequences of Alcohol Intoxication": "Intoxication contributed to over 95,000 deaths annually in the U.S. from 2011-2015.  It also leads to huge costs from drunk driving, lost productivity, arguments, and fights. "

The syndrome includes two or more symptoms such as autonomic hyperactivity, hand tremor, insomnia, nausea, psychomotor agitation, and anxiety.  Seizures may also occur.  Symptoms cause significant distress or impairment.  The symptoms must not be due to other conditions.  The symptoms typically begin when blood alcohol levels decline sharply (within 4-12 hours), peak on the second day, and improve by the fourth or fifth day. ",
        "Associated Features": "Alcohol withdrawal delirium, which can include hallucinations (delirium tremens), may occur and often indicates a concurrent, clinically relevant medical condition. ",
        "Prevalence": "Approximately 50% of individuals with alcohol use disorder in the U.S. experience a full withdrawal syndrome.  The rate may exceed 80% among hospitalized or homeless individuals with the disorder.  Fewer than 10% of those in withdrawal develop delirium or seizures. ",
        "Development and Course": "Acute alcohol withdrawal is an episode typically lasting 4-5 days, occurring only after extended periods of heavy drinking.  It is rare in individuals under 30 and its risk and severity increase with age. ",
        "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "Withdrawal is more likely with heavier intake and in individuals with comorbid conduct disorder or antisocial personality disorder.  A history of prior withdrawal episodes is a risk factor for more severe withdrawal.  Most individuals with this condition drink large amounts (more than eight drinks per day) daily for multiple days. ",
        "Diagnostic Markers": "Autonomic hyperactivity in the context of falling blood alcohol levels after prolonged heavy drinking is indicative of alcohol withdrawal. ",
        "Functional Consequences of Alcohol Withdrawal": "Symptoms of withdrawal can perpetuate drinking and contribute to relapse, leading to impaired functioning.  Medically supervised detoxification can result in hospitalization and lost productivity.  The presence of withdrawal is associated with greater functional impairment and a poor prognosis. "

        "Diagnostic Features": "This disorder includes problems associated with substances from the cannabis plant and synthetic cannabinoids, where THC is the primary psychoactive component.  Cannabis is used in many forms, including smoking, vaping, dabbing, and edibles, with widely varying potency.  The disorder is defined by a cluster of 11 behavioral and physical symptoms leading to impairment, including withdrawal, tolerance, craving, and hazardous use.  Regular users develop tolerance, and cessation can lead to a withdrawal syndrome.  Continued use despite negative impacts on relationships or activities is a key marker of a severe disorder. ",
        "Associated Features": "Individuals often use cannabis to cope with mood, insomnia, or pain.  Chronic use can produce a lack of motivation resembling persistent depressive disorder.  Physical signs can include red eyes, cannabis odor, yellowed fingertips, and chronic cough. ",
        "Windrawal Symptoms": "Three (or more) of the following, developing within approximately 1 week after cessation:\nIrritability, anger, or aggression\nNervousness or anxiety\nSleep difficulty (insomnia, disturbing dreams)\nDecreased appetite or weight loss\nRestlessness\nDepressed mood\n\nAt least one of: abdominal pain, shakiness/tremors, sweating, fever, chills, headache",
        "Prevalence": "Past-year prevalence of DSM-IV cannabis use disorder in the U.S. is 2.7%-3.1% for youth and 1.5%-2.9% for adults.  For DSM-5, 12-month prevalence is about 2.5% in adults.  Prevalence is highest among ages 18-29 (6.9%).  Rates are higher in men than women.  Among ethnoracial groups, rates are highest in American Indians/Alaska Natives and African Americans.  Only 7%-8% of adults with the disorder receive treatment. ",
        "Development and Course": "Onset is most common in adolescence or young adulthood.  The disorder generally develops over an extended period, though progression may be faster in adolescents with conduct problems.  Early onset (before age 15) is a robust predictor of developing this and other substance use disorders.  Among adults, the disorder often involves well-established patterns of daily use. ",
        "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "Temperamental risk factors include a history of conduct disorder and other externalizing or internalizing disorders.  Environmental risks include unstable family situations, childhood abuse, low socioeconomic status, and ease of availability.  Living in a U.S. state with legal recreational marijuana increases the risk for adults.  Heritable factors contribute between 30% and 80% of the risk. ",
        "Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues": "Cannabis is one of the world's most commonly used psychoactive substances, with use influenced by local culture, religion, and social practices. ",
        "Sex- and Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues": "Women may report more severe withdrawal symptoms than men, potentially leading to a faster transition to the disorder (telescoping).  In 2016-2017, 7.0% of pregnant women in a U.S. survey reported past-month cannabis use. ",
        "Diagnostic Markers": "Urine tests for the metabolite THCCOOH can detect recent use but often remain positive for weeks in frequent users, limiting their utility.  Tests for cannabinoids in blood or oral fluids are in development. ",
        "Association with Suicidal Thoughts or Behavior": "Cannabis use disorder is associated with an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior, even after adjusting for comorbidities.  Chronic cannabis use, but not acute use, is associated with suicidal thoughts and behavior. ",
        "Functional Consequences of Cannabis Use Disorder": "Functional consequences are part of the diagnostic criteria.  Cognitive function, particularly executive function, may become compromised in a dose-dependent manner.  Cannabis use impairs driving ability and has been linked to an amotivational syndrome, social relationship problems, and poorer life satisfaction. "

        "Diagnostic Features": "This disorder applies to phencyclidine (PCP) and pharmacologically similar substances like ketamine.  These drugs were first developed as dissociative anesthetics and produce feelings of separation from mind and body.  They are typically smoked or taken orally, but can also be snorted or injected.  The primary psychoactive effects of PCP last a few hours, but elimination from the body can take 8 days or longer.  The hallucinogenic effects can last for weeks and may precipitate a persistent psychotic episode.  Withdrawal symptoms have not been clearly established in humans, so the withdrawal criterion is not included in this diagnosis. ",
        "Associated Features": "Urine tests can detect phencyclidine for up to 8 days or longer after high doses.  Intoxication symptoms that can aid diagnosis include dissociative symptoms, analgesia, nystagmus, hypertension, and hallucinations.  Violent behavior can also occur, as intoxicated individuals may feel they are being attacked. ",
        "Prevalence": "The prevalence is believed to be low, based on the overall low rates of hallucinogen use disorder (around 0.1% in the U.S.).  Only 0.3% of U.S. substance use treatment admissions endorse phencyclidine as their primary drug. ",
        "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "One Australian study found ketamine users were more likely to be men and to have consumed more than 11 standard drinks per day. ",
        "Sex- and Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues": "The gender ratio is unknown, but among U.S. treatment admissions for primary phencyclidine use, 62% were men. ",
        "Diagnostic Markers": "Urine toxicology testing is useful.  Physical signs like nystagmus, analgesia, and hypertension can help distinguish phencyclidine intoxication from that of other hallucinogens. ",
        "Functional Consequences of Phencyclidine Use Disorder": "Individuals may have physical injuries from accidents, fights, and falls.  Chronic use can lead to acute and persistent cognitive impairment, as well as urinary tract, intestinal, cardiac, and respiratory problems. "

These substances are usually taken orally, but some can be smoked or injected.  Duration of effects varies widely.  Tolerance develops with repeated use.  Ecstasy users have a higher risk of developing this disorder than users of other hallucinogens.  A clinically significant withdrawal syndrome has not been consistently documented, so it is not a diagnostic criterion, though some evidence exists for withdrawal from MDMA. ",
        "Associated Features": "The characteristic symptom features of use of some hallucinogens, like the frightening visual hallucinations of LSD, can aid in diagnosis when toxicology is unavailable. ",
        "Prevalence": "This disorder is rare, with a 12-month prevalence of about 0.1% in the U.S. population age 12 and older.  The rate is highest among those aged 18-25 (0.4%).  However, prevalence is much higher in clinical samples and among heavy users. ",
        "Development and Course": "The disorder is concentrated in young adults, with most cases occurring in individuals aged 18-29. ",
        "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "Temperamental risks include high sensation-seeking.  Environmental risks in the U.S. include higher income, lower education, being unmarried, and living in urban areas.  Early onset of use is also a risk factor.  Genetic factors contribute an estimated 26% to 79% of the total variance in risk. ",
        "Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues": "Some hallucinogens, like peyote and ayahuasca, are used in established religious or spiritual practices and should be considered within that cultural context. ",
        "Sex- and Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues": "Among U.S. adolescents, boys have higher rates of hallucinogen use than girls.  Among adults with the disorder, 60% are men.  Women may experience greater subjective effects from MDMA. ",
        "Diagnostic Markers": "Laboratory testing can be useful, but some substances like LSD are so potent that they may not be detected by typical toxicology screens. ",
        "Functional Consequences of Other Hallucinogen Use Disorder": "Adverse effects include hyperthermia, cardiac issues, seizures, and other serious medical complications.  There is evidence for persisting neurotoxic effects from MDMA/ecstasy use, including memory impairment and serotonin system dysfunction. "

The specific substance should be named if possible.  Features include recurrent use despite serious problems, failure to fulfill major obligations, continued use despite social problems, and use in hazardous situations.  Tolerance is reported by about 10% of users.  A clinically significant withdrawal syndrome has not been established, so it is not a diagnostic criterion, although symptoms may occur. ",
        "Associated Features": "The diagnosis is supported by recurring intoxication episodes with negative standard drug screens, possession of inhalants, a 'glue-sniffer's rash' around the nose or mouth, and association with other users.  The disorder can be associated with serious medical complications like brain white matter pathology. ",
        "Prevalence": "Past 12-month prevalence in the U.S. is 0.1% for youth (ages 12-17) and 0.04% for adults.  Among youth, prevalence is highest among non-Hispanic Whites and those reporting more than one racialized identity. ",
        "Development and Course": "The disorder is most common in adolescents and young adults and usually remits by early adulthood.  Calls to poison control for intentional abuse peak at age 14.  Adult-onset cases are associated with earlier first use and use of multiple inhalants. ",
        "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "Temperamental risks include sensation seeking and impulsivity.  Environmental risks include the wide availability of inhalants and a history of childhood maltreatment or trauma.  Genetic and physiological risk is linked to behavioral disinhibition, a highly heritable trait. ",
        "Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues": "Some isolated Indigenous communities and homeless children in low-income countries have a high prevalence of inhalant problems. ",
        "Sex- and Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues": "The disorder is rare in adult women, though prevalence is similar among adolescent boys and girls. ",
        "Diagnostic Markers": "Biological testing for inhalants is generally impractical due to expense and technical issues. ",
        "Association with Suicidal Thoughts or Behavior": "In the U.S., inhalant use and the disorder are associated with suicidal thoughts and behavior, especially in individuals with comorbid anxiety, depression, and trauma histories. ",
        "Functional Consequences of Inhalant Use Disorder": "Use can be fatal from anoxia, cardiac arrhythmia ('sudden sniffing death'), or accidents.  It impairs neurobehavioral function and causes various neurological and medical problems.  Long-term users are at increased risk for infections like tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS. "

        "Diagnostic Features": "This disorder involves problematic use of natural opioids (morphine), semisynthetics (heroin, oxycodone), and synthetics (fentanyl, methadone).  It consists of compulsive, prolonged self-administration for non-medical purposes or in excess of prescribed amounts.  Most individuals with the disorder have tolerance and experience withdrawal upon cessation.  Conditioned responses to drug-related stimuli (craving) contribute to relapse and persist long after withdrawal.  Daily activities are often planned around obtaining and using opioids.  Prescription opioids may be obtained illicitly, and healthcare professionals may divert drugs for their own use. ",
        "Associated Features": "Opioid overdose, characterized by unconsciousness, respiratory depression, and pinpoint pupils, can be fatal and has increased exponentially in the U.S. since 1999.  The disorder can be associated with drug-related crimes.  Marital difficulties and unemployment are also common. ",
        "Withdrawal Symptoms": "Presence of either:\nA. Dysphoric mood\nOR\nB. Two (or more) of the following:\nNausea or vomiting\nMuscle aches\nLacrimation or rhinorrhea\nPupillary dilation, piloerection, or sweating\nDiarrhea\nYawning\nFever\nInsomnia",
        "Prevalence": "The prevalence of prescription opioid use disorder among U.S. adults is 0.6%-0.9%, while heroin use disorder is 0.1%-0.3%.  Rates are higher among men, young adults, and those with lower income or education.  Prevalence varies by ethnoracial group, with higher rates in Native Americans. ",
        "Development and Course": "The disorder is most commonly first observed in the late teens or early 20s.  Once established, the disorder can be chronic, continuing for many years with only brief periods of abstinence for some. ",
        "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "Risk factors include comorbid substance use disorders, externalizing traits like impulsivity, and social/environmental factors.  There is a strong genetic contribution to risk. ",
        "Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues": "While historically associated with socially oppressed groups, the disorder has become more common among White individuals, suggesting social factors and availability impact prevalence.  The diagnostic criteria perform equally well across ethnoracial groups. ",
        "Sex- and Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues": "Women are more likely to initiate use in response to abuse or violence and may progress to a use disorder more quickly than men ('telescoping'). ",
        "Diagnostic Markers": "Urine toxicology tests are often positive for opioids.  Screening for hepatitis A, B, and C, as well as HIV, is often positive in injection users. ",
        "Association with Suicidal Thoughts or Behavior": "The disorder is associated with a heightened risk for suicide attempts and death.  Repeated intoxication or withdrawal can induce severe, temporary depressions that lead to suicide.  Opioid use disorder elevates suicide mortality risk, especially in women. ",
        "Functional Consequences of Opioid Use Disorder": "Physiological consequences include dry mouth, severe constipation, and impaired vision.  Injection use leads to sclerosed veins ('tracks'), cellulitis, and abscesses.  The risk of infections like tetanus, botulism, endocarditis, hepatitis C, and HIV is high.  Chronic use can lead to hyperalgesia (increased pain sensitivity).  The mortality rate is 6-20 times greater than in the general population, primarily due to overdose, accidents, and medical complications. "

        "Diagnostic Features": "This class includes benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and related drugs.  These brain depressants can produce disorders similar to those from alcohol.  The disorder can arise from both prescribed and illicitly obtained substances.  Craving is a typical feature.  Misuse often occurs with other substances, such as using benzodiazepines to 'come down' from stimulants.  The disorder can lead to failure to fulfill major role obligations and continued use despite social or interpersonal problems.  Significant tolerance and withdrawal can develop.  However, tolerance and withdrawal that occur during appropriate medical use do not count toward the diagnosis unless other criteria are met. ",
        "Associated Features": "Often associated with other substance use disorders.  With repeated use, tolerance develops to sedative effects, but tolerance to brain stem depressant effects develops much more slowly, increasing the risk of fatal respiratory depression with dose escalation.  Intense intoxication can lead to severe, temporary depression and suicide attempts. ",
        "Withdrawal Symptoms": "Two (or more) of the following, developing within days of the last dose:\nAutonomic hyperactivity (e.g., sweating or pulse > 100 bpm)\nHand tremor\nInsomnia\nNausea or vomiting\nTransient visual, tactile, or auditory hallucinations or illusions\nPsychomotor agitation\nAnxiety\nGrand mal seizures",
        "Prevalence": "The 12-month prevalence of the DSM-IV disorder in the U.S. is about 0.3% for both adolescents and adults.  Prevalence is highest among those aged 18-29 (0.5%).  Rates do not consistently vary by gender in the U.S., but some international studies show higher rates in women. ",
        "Development and Course": "One common course involves escalation of use in teens or young adults, often alongside other substance use disorders.  Another course begins with a legitimate prescription, followed by dose escalation due to tolerance or perceived need.  Onset is typically in adolescence or early adulthood, with risk for misuse decreasing after age 30.  However, older individuals are more susceptible to side effects like cognitive impairment and falls. ",
        "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "Temperamental risks include impulsivity and novelty-seeking.  Environmental risks relate to the availability of the drugs through prescriptions.  Genetic factors play an important role.  Early onset of use is associated with a greater likelihood of developing the disorder. ",
        "Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues": "Prescription patterns vary across countries, which may affect prevalence.  In the U.S., benzodiazepine use is more frequently reported by non-Latinx Whites, but the risk of developing the disorder may be higher in other groups like African Americans once use is initiated. ",
        "Sex- and Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues": "There appear to be no gender differences in the prevalence of the disorder. ",
        "Diagnostic Markers": "Most of these substances can be identified in urine or blood tests.  Urine tests may remain positive for up to a week for long-acting substances. ",
        "Association with Suicidal Thoughts or Behavior": "U.S. epidemiological studies show an association between hypnotics and suicide, but it is unclear if this is due to underlying conditions like depression and insomnia, which are also suicide risk factors. ",
        "Functional Consequences of Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Use Disorder": "Consequences are similar to alcohol use disorder, with potential for accidents, interpersonal difficulties, and work/school impairment.  Overdoses can be lethal, especially when mixed with other depressants like alcohol or opioids.  Intravenous use carries risks of infections like hepatitis and HIV. "

Withdrawal from stimulants can cause temporary but intense depressive symptoms. ",
        "Associated Features": "When injected or smoked, stimulants produce an instant feeling of well-being and euphoria.  Chronic use can lead to chaotic behavior, social isolation, and aggression.  Intoxication may present with rambling speech, paranoia, and tactile hallucinations.

        "Development and Course": "Use patterns can be chronic or episodic, with binges of continuous high-dose use over hours or days.  Smoking and intravenous use are associated with a more rapid progression to a severe use disorder.  Some individuals begin use to control weight or improve performance. ",
        "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "Temperamental risks include comorbid bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and antisocial personality disorder.  Environmental risks include prenatal cocaine exposure and exposure to community violence or childhood mistreatment.  Men who have sex with men are at higher risk for methamphetamine use. ",
        "Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues": "Prevalence and admission rates for treatment vary among ethnoracial groups in the U.S., which may reflect differential access to care, criminalization, and other social factors. ",
        "Sex- and Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues": "Women with cocaine use disorder more frequently have comorbid depression and PTSD.  Gonadal hormones may affect responses to cocaine, with higher progesterone levels in women being associated with lower craving. ",
        "Diagnostic Markers": "Cocaine metabolites can be detected in urine for 1-3 days (up to 7-12 days in heavy users).  Amphetamine-type substances can be detected for 1-4 days.  Hair samples can detect use for up to 90 days. ",
        "Association with Suicidal Thoughts or Behavior": "Regular amphetamine use is associated with increased suicide mortality.  Cocaine use disorder is linked to higher rates of suicidal thoughts.  Both cocaine and amphetamine use disorders were associated with increased suicide deaths in a study of U.S. veterans. ",
        "Functional Consequences of Stimulant Use Disorder": "Medical conditions vary by route of administration. 'Snorting' can damage the nasal mucosa, smoking can cause respiratory problems, and injecting carries risks of HIV and hepatitis.  Weight loss and malnutrition are common.  Cardiac events like myocardial infarction and stroke can occur even in young, healthy individuals.  Neurocognitive impairment is common, and chronic use can cause neurotoxicity.  'Meth mouth' involves severe dental problems. "

        "Diagnostic Features": "This disorder can develop with use of all forms of tobacco (cigarettes, chewing tobacco, e-cigarettes) and prescription nicotine.  The addictive potential is associated with the rapidity of nicotine delivery (smoked > oral > transdermal).  Tolerance is shown by the disappearance of nausea after initial use and the more intense effect of the first use of the day.  Cessation produces a clear withdrawal syndrome, and many use tobacco to relieve or avoid these symptoms.  The criteria for time spent obtaining the substance or failure to fulfill role obligations are less commonly endorsed for tobacco than for other substances due to its legal and accessible nature. ",
        "Associated Features": "Smoking within 30 minutes of waking, smoking daily, smoking more cigarettes per day, and waking at night to smoke are associated with the disorder.  Serious medical conditions are common, as are symptoms like coughing and accelerated skin aging. ",
        "Withdrawal Symptoms": "Four (or more) of the following, developing within 24 hours of cessation:\nIrritability, frustration, or anger\nAnxiety\nDifficulty concentrating\nIncreased appetite or weight gain\nDepressed mood\nInsomnia",
        "Prevalence": "In the U.S., 19% of adults used a tobacco product in the last year.  The 12-month prevalence of DSM-5 tobacco use disorder was 20% among U.S. adults, with rates varying significantly by ethnoracial group (from 11.2% in Asian Americans to 29.6% in Native Americans).  Prevalence is higher among men and those with lower income or education.  The prevalence among current daily smokers is approximately 50%. ",
        "Development and Course": "About 20% of U.S. high school seniors have tried cigarettes, with most daily users starting by that age.  Initiation after age 21 is rare.  Addiction can begin soon after initial use, but fulfilling full criteria for the disorder usually takes several years. ",
        "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "Temperamental risks include externalizing personality traits.  Having other psychiatric disorders like ADHD, depression, or anxiety increases the risk.  Environmental risks include low income and low educational levels.  Genetic factors contribute about 50% of the heritability. ",
        "Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues": "Prevalence varies greatly by geographic region, from 4.7% in Western Sub-Saharan Africa to 24.2% in Eastern Europe.  Higher prevalence is associated with exposure to racism and ethnic discrimination. ",
        "Sex- and Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues": "The ratio of male to female smokers in the U.S. is about 1.4:1.  Negative reinforcement (smoking to relieve negative affect) may be a stronger motivator in women.  Pregnant females smoke at a lower rate but relapse quickly after delivery. ",
        "Diagnostic Markers": "Biomarkers like carbon monoxide in breath and cotinine in blood, saliva, or urine can measure use but are only weakly associated with the disorder itself. ",
        "Association with Suicidal Thoughts or Behavior": "Past-year cigarette use is associated with a two- to threefold increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior.  Tobacco use disorder is associated with an increased risk of suicide, even after adjusting for covariates. ",
        "Functional Consequences of Tobacco Use Disorder": "Half of smokers who do not quit will die early from a tobacco-related illness, and smoking-related morbidity occurs in more than one-half of tobacco users.  Secondhand smoke also increases the risk of heart disease and cancer by 30%. "

        "Associated Features": "Diagnosis is supported by reported use of a substance not in the other classes or by recurring intoxication with negative results on standard drug screens.  Misuse of nitrous oxide may be seen in medical/dental professionals and food service workers due to access.  Misuse by youth is significant and can lead to serious medical complications.  There is no evidence of unique suicide risk factors for this category. ",
        "Prevalence": "Prevalence is likely lower than for the other nine substance classes.  While use of some of these substances is not rare (e.g., lifetime prevalence of nitrous oxide use is 4.6% in the U.S.), how often this use qualifies for a disorder is unknown. ",

        "Associated Features": "Distortions in thinking (e.g., superstitions, overconfidence) are common.  Many individuals believe money is both the cause and solution to their problems.  Some are impulsive and easily bored, while others are depressed and lonely. ",
        "Prevalence": "The past-year prevalence is about 0.2%-0.3% in the general U.S. population.  The lifetime prevalence is about 0.4%-1.0%.  It is more common in men (0.6%) than women (0.2%).  Prevalence varies among ethnoracial groups, with the highest rates in African Americans. ",
        "Development and Course": "Onset can be in adolescence or adulthood, with progression being more rapid in women than men.  Most individuals show a pattern of gradually increasing frequency and amount of wagering.  Gambling patterns can be regular or episodic.  The disorder is more common in younger and middle-aged individuals than older adults. ",
        "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "Gambling that begins in childhood is associated with higher rates of the disorder.  The disorder aggregates with antisocial personality disorder, depressive and bipolar disorders, and alcohol use disorder.  Genetic and environmental factors both contribute. ",
        "Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues": "Types of gambling activities vary across cultures.  Some Indigenous populations have high prevalence rates, possibly related to limited economic opportunities and the location of casinos on tribal lands. ",
        "Sex- and Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues": "Men develop the disorder at higher rates, but the gender gap may be narrowing.  Women may gamble to cope with negative affect, while men gamble more for the thrill.  Women with the disorder are more likely to have comorbid depressive, bipolar, and anxiety disorders. ",
        "Association With Suicidal Thoughts or Behavior": "Up to half of individuals in treatment report suicidal thoughts, and about 17% report attempted suicide.  Individuals with the disorder have a 15-fold increased suicide mortality rate compared to the general population. ",
        "Functional Consequences of Gambling Disorder": "The disorder can lead to jeopardized relationships, job loss, and absenteeism from work or school.  Individuals with the disorder also have poor general health and utilize medical services at high rates. "
