                  "full_text": { "Diagnostic Features": "Alcohol use disorder is defined by a cluster of behavioral and physical symptoms, such as withdrawal, tolerance, and craving.  Alcohol withdrawal is characterized by symptoms that develop approximately 4-12 hours after reducing heavy, prolonged intake.  To avoid withdrawal, individuals may continue drinking despite adverse consequences.  Intense craving for alcohol can make it difficult to think of anything else.  The disorder can lead to neglect of major responsibilities at school, work, or home ; use in hazardous situations ; and continued use despite knowing it causes physical or psychological problems. ", "Associated Features": "This disorder is often associated with problems related to other substances like cannabis, cocaine, heroin, and sedatives.  Symptoms of conduct problems, depression, anxiety, and insomnia frequently accompany heavy drinking and sometimes precede it.  Repeated high-dose intake can affect nearly every organ system, especially the gastrointestinal tract, cardiovascular system, and central and peripheral nervous systems.  Specific health issues include gastritis, ulcers, liver cirrhosis, pancreatitis, increased cancer rates, hypertension, and cardiomyopathy.  Neurological effects can include cognitive deficits, severe memory impairment (Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome), and degenerative changes.  The disorder is also a significant contributor to suicide risk. ", "Prevalence": "In the United States, the lifetime prevalence of DSM-5 alcohol use disorder among adults is 29.1% (8.6% mild, 6.6% moderate, 13.9% severe).  Australian lifetime prevalence is 31.0%.  U.S. rates are higher in men (36.0%) than women (22.7%).  For DSM-IV criteria, the 12-month prevalence was 4.6% for ages 12-17, 16.2% for ages 18-29, and 1.5% for those 65 and older.  Rates vary by ethnoracial group, with Native Americans having high rates and Asian Americans having lower rates. ", "Development and Course": "The first episode of alcohol intoxication is likely to occur during the mid-teens.  Alcohol use disorder typically has an onset in the late teens or early to mid-20s.  The majority of individuals who develop the disorder do so by their late 30s.  The course is variable, characterized by periods of remission and relapse.  A decision to stop drinking is often followed by abstinence, but a return to drinking is highly likely to escalate.  Late-onset of the disorder (after age 40) occurs in about 10% of cases.  Older adults are more susceptible to the effects of alcohol due to age-related physical changes. ", "Risk and Prognostic Factors": "Environmental risk factors include poverty, discrimination, unemployment, cultural attitudes, alcohol availability, and stress levels.  Heavier peer substance use and certain coping styles also contribute.  Genetic influences account for 40%-60% of the risk variance, with a 3-4 times higher rate in close relatives.  A low level of response to alcohol is a specific risk factor, while an acute skin flush reaction (more common in persons of Asian descent) is associated with low risk.  High levels of impulsivity are associated with an earlier onset and more severe course. ", "Culture-Related Issues": "Alcohol is the most frequently used intoxicating substance in most cultures, contributing to 2.8 million deaths globally in 2016.  Prevalence is highest in the European and American regions.  For immigrants to the U.S., greater acculturation is linked to a higher prevalence of the disorder.  Genetic variations in alcohol-metabolizing enzymes, common in individuals of Asian descent, can be protective against the disorder but may be modulated by sociocultural factors.  The diagnostic criteria perform equally well across most U.S. race/ethnicity groups. ", "Sex- and Gender-Related Issues": "Men have higher rates of drinking and the disorder than women, but the gender gap is narrowing.  Females typically develop higher blood alcohol levels per drink and may be more vulnerable to some physical consequences like liver disease.  Environmental risk factors may differ by sex.  Drinking during pregnancy may be a sign of the disorder. ", "Diagnostic Markers": "Blood alcohol concentration can confirm recent use and indicate tolerance if an individual shows little intoxication at high levels (e.g., >150 mg/dL).  Elevated gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) and carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (CDT) are sensitive lab indicators of heavy drinking and can be used to monitor abstinence.  An elevated mean corpuscular volume (MCV) can also indicate heavy drinking.  Other nonspecific markers include elevated triglycerides and uric acid.  Physical signs can include dyspepsia, hepatomegaly, tremor, unsteady gait, and insomnia. ", "Association with Suicidal Thoughts or Behavior": "Acute and chronic heavy alcohol use are associated with suicide.  A meta-analysis found that acute alcohol use was associated with a nearly sevenfold increase in risk of a suicide attempt, with heavier use conferring greater risk.  Co-use with sedatives further increases this risk.  Alcohol use is also associated with a higher likelihood of using firearms in a suicide. ", "Functional Consequences of Alcohol Use Disorder": "The disorder impairs functioning in areas such as driving, school, work, relationships, and health.  It contributes to work absenteeism, accidents, and low productivity.  The disorder is associated with a significant increase in the risk of accidents, violence, and suicide, accounting for up to 55% of fatal driving events and being linked to criminal acts like homicide.

Cannabis is used in many forms, including smoking, vaping, dabbing, and edibles, with widely varying potency.  The disorder is defined by a cluster of 11 behavioral and physical symptoms leading to impairment, including withdrawal, tolerance, craving, and hazardous use.  Regular users develop tolerance, and cessation can lead to a withdrawal syndrome.  Continued use despite negative impacts on relationships or activities is a key marker of a severe disorder. ", "Associated Features": "Individuals often use cannabis to cope with mood, insomnia, or pain.  Chronic use can produce a lack of motivation resembling persistent depressive disorder.  Physical signs can include red eyes, cannabis odor, yellowed fingertips, and chronic cough.

Prevalence is highest among ages 18-29 (6.9%).  Rates are higher in men than women.  Among ethnoracial groups, rates are highest in American Indians/Alaska Natives and African Americans.  Only 7%-8% of adults with the disorder receive treatment. ", "Development and Course": "Onset is most common in adolescence or young adulthood.  The disorder generally develops over an extended period, though progression may be faster in adolescents with conduct problems.  Early onset (before age 15) is a robust predictor of developing this and other substance use disorders.  Among adults, the disorder often involves well-established patterns of daily use.

Environmental risks include unstable family situations, childhood abuse, low socioeconomic status, and ease of availability.  Living in a U.S. state with legal recreational marijuana increases the risk for adults.  Heritable factors contribute between 30% and 80% of the risk.

Most individuals show a pattern of gradually increasing frequency and amount of wagering.  Gambling patterns can be regular or episodic.  The disorder is more common in younger and middle-aged individuals than older adults.

The disorder aggregates with antisocial personality disorder, depressive and bipolar disorders, and alcohol use disorder.  Genetic and environmental factors both contribute. ", "Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues": "Types of gambling activities vary across cultures.  Some Indigenous populations have high prevalence rates, possibly related to limited economic opportunities and the location of casinos on tribal lands. ", "Sex- and Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues": "Men develop the disorder at higher rates, but the gender gap may be narrowing.  Women may gamble to cope with negative affect, while men gamble more for the thrill.  Women with the disorder are more likely to have comorbid depressive, bipolar, and anxiety disorders.

Individuals with the disorder have a 15-fold increased suicide mortality rate compared to the general population.
