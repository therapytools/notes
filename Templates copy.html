        <p><strong>What to say to the client:</strong></p>
        <p>Narcan is a medicine that can save someones life during an opioid overdose. It works by quickly blocking the effects of opioids and helping the person breathe again. Narcan is easy to use and can be given by anyone, even without medical training. Having Narcan nearby can give people a second chance and time to get more help. Its safe, doesnt hurt someone if they didnt take opioids, and can help prevent deaths from overdose.</p>

            <p>Studies show that using both medicine and therapy can help people who have problems with drugs or alcohol. For some people, medicine can make it easier to stay in recovery. These medicines are safe and approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Doctors pick the right medicine for each person to help them get better and avoid dangerous overdoses. Medicine can also help people live longer, stay in treatment, stop using illegal drugs, stay out of trouble, keep their jobs, have healthier babies if theyre pregnant, and lower the chance of getting diseases like HIV or hepatitis C. There are a few things to keep in mind. A doctor needs to check on you often, the medicine might cause side effects, and some people might misuse it.</p>

                    Staff (counselor) spoke with the clients landlord to clarify housing concerns and explore options for stable housing, as the client recently had an emotional outburst toward another tenant and is at risk for eviction. This conversation directly supports the clients treatment goals by reducing barriers to recovery and promoting engagement in a stable living environment. Staff documented the interaction, the clients responses, and next steps, including follow-up with the primary counselor to address emotional regulation techniques. The intervention was clinically necessary to address immediate housing risks and aligns with approved categories of referral and coordination to support recovery.

<div class="checkbox-container"><input type="checkbox" id="ouds-assess-purpose"><label for="ouds-assess-purpose"><b>Medication Purpose & Use:</b> Discussed that buprenorphine is a partial opioid agonist used to treat opioid use disorder by reducing cravings and withdrawal symptoms.

Reviewed dosing schedule, route of administration (typically sublingual or buccal), and importance of adherence.</label></div>
<div class="checkbox-container"><input type="checkbox" id="ouds-assess-side-effects"><label for="ouds-assess-side-effects"><b>Potential Side Effects:</b> Reviewed common side effects (e.g., headache, constipation, nausea, sedation) and rare but serious risks (e.g., respiratory depression when combined with other sedatives, hepatic injury).</label></div>
<div class="checkbox-container"><input type="checkbox" id="ouds-assess-overdose"><label for="ouds-assess-overdose"><b>Overdose Risk & Safety:</b> Advised that risk of overdose is lower than full opioid agonists but present if combined with other CNS depressants (benzodiazepines, alcohol).

<div class="checkbox-container"><input type="checkbox" id="ouds-assess-dental"><label for="ouds-assess-dental"><b>Dental Health Considerations:</b> Educated patient that use of buprenorphine, especially in sublingual/buccal forms, has been associated with dental problems (tooth decay, cavities, oral infections).
